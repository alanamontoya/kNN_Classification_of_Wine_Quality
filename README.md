# kNN_Classification_of_Wine_Quality

Summary:

*	Predicted wine quality from various features such as fixed acidity, volatile acidity, and citric acid.
*	Built simple logistic models in Python for all attributes in dataset to determine their average accuracies when predicting whether a wine was of high quality. Most models predicted with an accuracy of about 80%, so these attributes were used later in the kNN model.
*	Fit a kNN classifier in Python using 70% of data for testing. Plotted the accuracies of the model as the value of k varied between 2 and 10, again revealing accuracies of around 80% for all values of k.
